                            Attestation Keys
             draft-jpfiset-lamps-attestationkey-eku-latest

Abstract

   As specified in RFC 5280, key usages are specified in X.509
   certificates using the certificate extensions "Key Usage" and
   "Extended Key Usage".  This document defines an Extended Key Usage
   (EKU) relating to keys that are reserved for the purpose of signing
   attestation evidence as introduced in RFC 9334.

1.  Introduction

   Attesters, as defined in Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) in RFC
   9334, can use cryptographic private keys to identify the origin of
   the evidence and protect its integrity.  Those private keys are
   referred to as Attestation Keys.

   Attestation Keys can be endorsed by a Certification Authority (CA) by
   issuing X.509 certificates.  Those certificates SHOULD include an
   extended key usage to indicate that the associated key is dedicated
   to the purpose of attesting evidence.  This allows recipients of
   signed evidence to trust that the associated key is controlled
   according to the constraints specified in this document.

2.  Extended Key Usage for Attestation Key

   This specification defines the KeyPurposeId id-kp-attestationKey.
   This KeyPurposeId is reserved for attestation keys.

   The term "signing attestation evidence" refers to performing a
   digital signature using an attestation key over content that includes
   claims about the target environment (see [RFC9334]).

   An attestation key must be associated with the "digital signing" key
   usage, as any other keys used to performed digital signature.
   Furthermore, an attestation key must adhere to the following
   constraints:

   *  An attestation key SHOULD be used only by an attester to digitally
      sign claims that the attester can be observed in the target
      environment.  The attester SHOULD not use the attestation key for
      any other purpose (dedication).

   *  An attestation key MUST not be controlled by any entity other than
      the associated attester.  This constraint is to ensure that other
      entity can not impersonate the attester (non-repudiation).

2.1.  Including the EKU for Attestation Key in Certificates

   When the EKU id-kp-attestationKey is included in a X.509, other
   considerations should be taken:

   *  The X.509 extension "key usage" MUST be set to "digital
      signature".  In other words, the value of the associated field
      includes the bit "digitalSignature" set.

   *  The X.509 extension "extended key usage" SHOULD not include usage
      other than the one defined in this document (id-kp-
      attestationKey).

2.2.  Implication for a Certificate Authority

   When a Certificate Authority issues a X.509 certificate that includes
   the extended key usage defined in this document, certain additional
   considerations MUST be taken to ensure that the constraints defined
   in this document are respected.

   Issuing a X.509 certificate with the extended key usage id-kp-
   attestationKey equates to providing an endorsement of the attester as
   defined in the RATS architecture.  Therefore, the procedures and
   practices employed by a Certificate Authority MUST be adjusted to
   take into account RATS architecture.

   In particular, it is not sufficient for a CA to verify that the
   subject of the certificate has possession of the subject key.  It
   MUST also ensure that the subject is the only entity that controls
   the key.  This can be accomplished (but not restricted to) by using a
   key confined to specialized hardware under the control of the
   subject.

2.3.  Implication for the RATS Verifier

   In [RFC9334], the Verifier is the role that consumes the evidence
   produced by an attester.  As part of the verification process, the
   Verifier assesses endorsements, among other things.  A X.509
   certificate containing the EKU id-kp-attestationKey is an endorsement
   of the attester by the issuing authorities.

   While assessing an endorsement provided this way, a Verifier must
   follow all practices to validate the veracity of the certificate.

2.4.  Implication for Cryptographic Modules

   Attestation keys are instantiated and operated on by cryptographic
   modules.  These modules MUST provide the services required to
   restrict the use of an attestation key to its associated Attester.

   The mechanisms used to perform those restrictions are out of scope
   for this document.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Security Considerations

   For attestation evidence to be valuable, coordination between the
   various roles is required:

   *  The cryptographic module must restrict the use of the attestation
      key to the Attester.

   *  The CA MUST ensure that the Attester and the attestation key
      respect the constraints outlined in this document.

   *  A Verifier must perform the assessment of the presented evidence
      using all the procedures required to ascertain as to the origin
      and validity of the attester.

   The risks associated with a failure of this coordination is that the
   claims reported by the Attester can no be trusted.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to assign an object identifier (OID) for this purpose.
