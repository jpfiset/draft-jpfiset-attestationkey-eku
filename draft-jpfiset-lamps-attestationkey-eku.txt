                            Attestation Keys
             draft-jpfiset-lamps-attestationkey-eku-latest

Abstract

   As described in RFC5280, key usages are specified in X.509
   certificates using the certificate extensions "Key Usage" and
   "Extended Key Usage".  This document defines an Extended Key Usage
   (EKU) relating to keys that are dedicated to the purpose of signing
   attestation evidence as introduced in RFC9334.

1.  Introduction

   Attesters, as defined in Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) in
   [RFC9334], can use cryptographic private keys to identify the origin
   of the evidence and protect its integrity.  Those private keys are
   referred to as Attestation Keys.

   Attestation Keys can be endorsed by a Certification Authority (CA) by
   issuing X.509 certificates (see [RFC5280]).  Those certificates
   SHOULD include an extended key usage to indicate that the associated
   key is dedicated to the purpose of attesting evidence.  This allows
   recipients of signed evidence to trust that the associated key is
   controlled according to the constraints specified in this document.

2.  Terminology

   Much of the terms used in this specification are borrowed from RATS
   ([RFC9334]).  Readers of this specification should review the RATS
   architecture and its terminology to put in context the text presented
   in this specification.

   Attestation Key : A key under the control of the Attester and
   reserved for the purpose of signing evidence.

3.  Extended Key Usage for Attestation Key

   This specification defines the KeyPurposeId id-kp-attestationKey.
   This KeyPurposeId is reserved for Attestation Keys.

   The term "signing evidence" refers to performing a digital signature
   using an Attestation Key over content that includes claims and
   measurements about the target environment (see [RFC9334]).

   An Attestation Key must be associated with the "digital signing" key
   usage, as any other keys used to performed digital signature.
   Furthermore, an Attestation Key MUST adhere to the following
   constraints:

   *  An Attestation Key SHOULD be used by an Attester only to digitally
      sign evidence that the Attester can observe in the target
      environment.  The Attester SHOULD NOT use the Attestation Key for
      any other purpose (dedication).

   *  An Attestation Key MUST NOT be controlled by any entity other than
      the associated Attester.  This constraint is to ensure that other
      entity can not impersonate the Attester (non-repudiation).

3.1.  Including the EKU for Attestation Key in Certificates

   When the EKU id-kp-attestationKey is included in a X.509, other
   considerations should be taken:

   *  The X.509 extension "key usage" MUST be set to "digital
      signature".  In other words, the value of the associated field
      includes the bit "digitalSignature" set.

   *  The X.509 extension "extended key usage" SHOULD NOT include usage
      other than the one defined in this document (id-kp-
      attestationKey).  If other extended key usages are provided, they
      MUST be compatible with constraints outlined in this
      specification.

3.2.  Implication for a Certificate Authority

   When a Certificate Authority issues a X.509 certificate that includes
   the extended key usage defined in this specification, certain
   additional considerations MUST be taken to ensure that the
   constraints defined in this document are respected.

   Issuing a X.509 certificate with the extended key usage id-kp-
   attestationKey equates to providing an endorsement of the attester as
   defined in the RATS architecture.  Therefore, the procedures and
   practices employed by a Certificate Authority MUST be augmented to
   take into account the security considerations relating to the
   Attestation Key as outlined in the RATS architecture.

   In particular, it is not sufficient for a CA to verify that the
   subject of the certificate, the Attester, has possession of the
   subject key.  It MUST also ensure that the Attester is the only
   entity that controls the key.  This can be accomplished (but not
   restricted to) by using a key confined to specialized hardware under
   the control of the Attester.

3.3.  Implication for the RATS Verifier

   In [RFC9334], the Verifier is the role that consumes the evidence
   produced by an Attester.  As part of the verification process, the
   Verifier assesses endorsements, among other things.  A X.509
   certificate containing the EKU id-kp-attestationKey is an endorsement
   of the Attester by the issuing authorities.

   While assessing an endorsement provided this way, a Verifier must
   follow all practices to validate the veracity of the certificate.

3.4.  Implication for Cryptographic Modules

   Attestation Keys are instantiated and operated on by cryptographic
   modules.  These modules MUST provide the services required to
   restrict the use of an Attestation Key to its associated Attester.

   The mechanisms used to perform those restrictions are out of scope
   for this specification.

4.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

5.  Security Considerations

   For attestation evidence to be valuable, coordination between the
   various roles is required:

   *  The cryptographic module MUST restrict the use of the Attestation
      Key to the associated Attester.

   *  The CA MUST ensure that the Attester is the only entity that
      controls the Attestation Key which is subject to the issuance of a
      certificate.

   *  A Verifier must perform the assessment of the presented evidence
      using all the procedures required to ascertain as to the origin
      and validity of the attester.

   The risks associated with a failure of this coordination reduces the
   quality of the trustworthiness of the evidence.

   The implications are outlines in the Security Considerations section
   in RATS ([RFC9334]).

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to assign an object identifier (OID) for this purpose.
